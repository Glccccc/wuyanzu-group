# Top-Python321
---

This is a collection of Python basic usage assignments where the teacher has arranged Python exercises for students, covering topics such as input/output operations, variables and data types, formatted output, conditional statements, loops, file handling and module imports, and function writing.

## ✨ Project Features

- 📝 Practice-Oriented  
    All tasks require students to write code themselves. This hands-on approach helps deepen their understanding and application of the Python programming language, effectively enhancing their coding skills.
- ✅ Gradual Difficulty Increase  
    Tasks start with basic input/output operations and variables, then progress to conditional statements and loops, and finally move on to function definitions, file operations, etc. This forms a learning path that gradually increases in difficulty.
- 💾 Comprehensive Knowledge Coverage  
    It covers many important aspects of Python programming, including but not limited to data types, control structures, functions, modules, file operations, exception handling, etc. This enables students to gain a comprehensive understanding and mastery of the Python programming language.
- 🎨 Feedback and Evaluation Mechanism  
    Students are asked to keep the output results of their code in the form of comments in the code files and report their assignment completion status in the designated "Журнал" service. This helps teachers evaluate and provide feedback on students' learning progress and outcomes.
- 🔑 Combined with Practical Applications  
    The tasks involve scenarios such as password strength checking, taxi fare calculation, and file operations, which are related to real-life or work situations. This enables students to apply their knowledge to practical problems.
